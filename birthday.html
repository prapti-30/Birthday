                "Happy 16th Birthday, sis! 🎉
                You’re finally at that magical age where you’re old enough to make your own choices,
                but still young enough to get away with being a little wild 😏.
                I’m so proud of the incredible person you’re becoming — funny, bold, and full of life.
                I hope your day is filled with all your favorite things (especially cake, because I expect a slice too
                🍰).
                No matter how grown up you get, you’ll always be my little sister,
                and I’ll always be here to annoy you and love you at the same time 💖."
            </p>
            <p class="highlight">
                Wishing you love, happiness, and countless slices of cake today and always! 🎂🎉
